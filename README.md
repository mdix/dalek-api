# DalekJS API Proposal #

This repository is merely a playground for figuring out in which direction the API redesign of DalekJS should go.

By API we don't only understand the public, test-facing side of things, but also how actions, assertions et al are managed internally. If at all possible, the changes proposed herein will *not* reflect on the public API used for actually writing tests (too much).
